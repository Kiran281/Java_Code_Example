********Constructor – Key Points********************************

Special method used to initialize objects.

Name must match the class name.

No return type, not even void.

Called automatically when an object is created.

Can be overloaded with different parameters.

Types of Constructor:

Default Constructor – No parameters, auto-provided by compiler if none defined.

Parameterized Constructor – Takes arguments to initialize object.

Copy Constructor – Creates a new object by copying another object.

If no constructor is defined, Java provides a default constructor.

Can use access modifiers: public, private, protected, default.

Private constructor restricts object creation outside class.

Constructor chaining – Call one constructor from another using this().

Superclass constructor – Called using super() in subclass.

Execution order – Parent class constructor executes before child class constructor.

Cannot be static in Java.

Can throw exceptions.

Overloading possible, but overriding not allowed.

Best used for mandatory initialization of objects.
